## Hero Image

**Required:** Place your cartoon street sweeping image here as `hero-image.png`

### Instructions:

1. **Save your AI-generated image** (the cartoon with the street sweeper truck)
2. **Name it:** `hero-image.png`
3. **Place it in this directory:** `/images/hero-image.png`

### Specifications:

- **Format:** PNG (with transparent background if possible) or JPG
- **Recommended size:** At least 800px wide for good quality
- **Aspect ratio:** The current image is roughly 3:4 (portrait orientation)

### Where It's Used:

The hero image appears on the app's main screen when **no schedule has been set yet**. It provides a friendly, welcoming visual that explains what the app does.

Once you add a schedule, the image is hidden and replaced with your next sweeping date.

### For PWA Icons:

If you want to use this image for your app icon (when installed on phone):
1. Crop a square portion (just the truck works great!)
2. Save as `icon-source.png` in the `/icons/` directory
3. Use a tool like [PWA Asset Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator) to create icon-192.png and icon-512.png
4. Replace the placeholder SVG icons
