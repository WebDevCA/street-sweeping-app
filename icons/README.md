# App Icons

This directory contains the PWA icons for the Street Sweeping Reminder app.

## Icon Sizes Needed

The following icon sizes are referenced in `manifest.json`:
- 72x72
- 96x96
- 128x128
- 144x144
- 152x152
- 192x192
- 384x384
- 512x512

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons from your AI-generated artwork. Here are some options:

### Option 1: Online Tools
- [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) - Upload your image and generate all sizes
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/elegantapp/pwa-asset-generator) - CLI tool

### Option 2: Manual Creation
Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma) to export the AI art in each size.

### Option 3: Placeholder
For testing, you can use a simple emoji or text-based icon generator:
- [Emoji Favicon](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/)

## Temporary Solution

Until proper icons are created, the app will work without them. Browsers will show a default icon.

The bell emoji (🔔) from your AI art would make a great simple icon!
